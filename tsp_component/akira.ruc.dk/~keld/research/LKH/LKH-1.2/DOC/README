LKH is an implementation of the Lin-Kernighan traveling salesman heuristic.

The code is distributed for research use. The author reserves all rights to the code.


INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLATION:  (Version 1.2 - August 2001)

The software is available in two formats:

			        LKH-1.2.tgz		(gzipped tar file, â 5.9 MB)
			        LKH-1.2.sit		 (StuffIt archive, â 4.5 MB )

If a UNIX machine is used, download the software in the first format. Next execute the following UNIX commands:

			        gzip -d LKH-1.2.tgz
			  	  tar xvf LKH-1.2.tar
			     cd LKH-1.2 
			     make

An executable file called LKH.UNIX is now available in the directory LKH-1.2.

If a MacOS or a Windows machine is used, download the software in the second format. Next unstuff it with Stuffit ExpanderÅ (freeware available at http://www.aladdinsys.com). 

To test the installation run the LKH program (LKH.UNIX on a UNIX machine, LKH.Mac on a MacOS machine and LKH.Win on a Windows machine).

The program asks for a filename

			PARAMETER_FILE =

On a MacOS machine type Par.Mac 
On a Windows machine type Par.Win 
On a UNIX machine type Par.UNIX 
Then press return.

The program should now solve a problem with 532 cities.

For further instructions, see the LKH User Guide in the DOC directory.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1:

The code has been made more robust regarding the solution of asymmetric problems. The old code (LKH-1.0, February 1999) could loose its way in some cases due to integer overflow. 

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2:

Execution times may be measured more accurately, if the getrusage function is supported by the system. See the GetTime.c file for instructions.
