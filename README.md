# Optimal solutions to the components (TSP and KP) of the Traveling Thief Problem (TTP)

This repository contains implementation of exact approaches for solving the two problems (Traveling Salesperson Problem - TSP, and Knapsack Problem - KP) that compose the [Traveling Thief Problem](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~optlog/research/combinatorial.php), a pretty nice multicomponent problem. The solution approaches are built from well-known and efficient strategies for each problem. In the following, the strategies used for solving each problem are listed.

* Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP):
    * [LKH heuristic](http://akira.ruc.dk/~keld/research/LKH/)
    * [Concorde solver](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/concorde/downloads/downloads.htm)

* knapsack Problem (KP):
    * [Classic Dynamic Programming](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02243880)
    * [GH+DP](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10732-020-09457-7)

In addition to the source codes, all the solutions found are also available in this repository.
